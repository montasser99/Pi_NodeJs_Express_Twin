# Pi_NodeJs_Express_Twin
I collaborated with five individuals at Esprit School, specializing in TWIN, on the completion of this project. The backend development was implemented using Node.js and Express, while the frontend was executed using React. This project, which encompassed both frontend and backend components, was part of the engineering program's second cycle.
